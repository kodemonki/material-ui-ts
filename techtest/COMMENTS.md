There were a few things i left out, that I would have done with more time

1. "Learn More" rollover states
2. More indepth unit tests, just did render tests for now mostly
3. I couldn't source the font so used Roboto
4. I would put all the font styling, spacing and colours in the theme and do it properly :)
5. I would create a service layer for the business logic as its replicated at the moment
6. Had some issues with the colours from the github info... had to take hex from screen grabs.. might be incorrect
7. I didn't make the cards scrollable on smaller sizes, this is possible i just ran out of time... I also feel its poor UX, so in the real world I would push back on this. There is often a temptation to hide lots of content behind accordions, scrolling and carousels... but maybe the questions should be if we cant show all this info on a mobile screen at one time, should we be trying to... or maybe come up with a better solution.
